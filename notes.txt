-- Trouble installing first addon
--- Found the entire directory, not just the contents, must be zipped
-- Trouble importing from another module
--- Path seems to start at either addon.xml or lib/ level (prob dependent on the extension point)
- [16-05-31]
-- Got a UnicodeEncodeError for several series names
--- Unable to fix currently
--- Handled via replacement text
-- Anime Plus has an API! Let's try it!!
--- http://api.animeplus.tv/Get[All|New|Popular][Movies|Shows]
--- Format
---- Collection API returns data in JSON format
---- List of dicts
---- Dicts contain id (number string), name (of series), description, status (CMP for completed, ONG for ongoing), released (yyyy-mm-dd string), rating (int) and genres (list of strings)
--- http://api.animeplus.tv/GetDetails/[#]
---- Episodes API takes the series id # and returns a dict
---- Dict contains episode (list of dicts) and name (of series)
---- List of dicts contain date (added?), id (number string, episode) and name (of episode)
--- http://api.animeplus.tv/GetVideos/[#]?direct
---- Sources API takes the episode id # and returns a list of list(s) of dict(s)
---- Dicts contain link, source, quality, sub and filename
-- May want to cache this info for future calls, with time till refresh stamp
-- Alpha version achieved!

-- Unable to find why playing fails, when functionality is pretty much the same
--- Will try copying more of animego to check
-- Genre listing fragments in some areas due to genre name differences
-- Parsing the recents from the site itself is prob dangerous...
-- Movies show up in Popular and possibly other categories; they aren't handled here
-- There's a really weird link in web RAS category with javascript and stuff; ignoring
-- Changes to addon.xml may only load after Kodi restarts
--- Does this mean that an addon can be installed by copying the folder to the relevant path?

-- Videos now playing! Thanks to addLink() rip
--- Something was wrong with how the video links are created; gotta look into that...
-- Found that there is a small issue either in the addons.common module, or the way I'm using it
--- Ripped and modified the relevant method from the module
- [16-06-03]
-- Added another source index
